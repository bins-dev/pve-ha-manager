Test whether a strict negative resource affinity rule among three resources makes
two of the resources migrate to two different recovery nodes than the node of
the third resource in case of a failover of their two previously assigned nodes.

The test scenario is:
- vm:101, vm:102, and vm:103 must be kept separate
- vm:101, vm:102, and vm:103 are respectively on node3, node4, and node5
- node1 and node2 have both higher resource counts than node3, node4 and node5
  to test the resource affinity rule is enforced even though the utilization
  would prefer the other node3

The expected outcome is:
- As node4 and node5 fails, vm:102 and vm:103 are migrated to node2 and node1
  respectively; even though the utilization of node1 and node2 are high
  already, the resources must be kept separate; node2 is chosen first since
  node1 has one more resource running on it
