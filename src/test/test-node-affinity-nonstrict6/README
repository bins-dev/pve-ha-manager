Test whether a service in a non-strict node affinity rule with nofailback
enabled and two differently prioritized node members will stay on the current
node without migrating back to the highest priority node.

The test scenario is:
- vm:101 should be kept on node2 or node3
- vm:101 is currently running on node2
- node2 has a higher priority than node3

The expected outcome is:
- As node2 fails, vm:101 is migrated to node3 as it is the only available node
  member left in the non-strict node affinity rule
- As node2 comes back online, vm:101 stays on node3; even though node2 has a
  higher priority, the nofailback flag prevents vm:101 to migrate back to node2
