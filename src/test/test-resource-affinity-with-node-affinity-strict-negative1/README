Test whether a strict negative resource affinity rule among three resources,
where the resources are contradicting the negative resource affinity rule and
one of them should be on a specific node by its node affinity rule, makes the
resource in the node affinity rule migrate to its preferred node, if possible.

The test scenario is:
- vm:102 should be on node2
- vm:101, vm:102, and vm:103 must be kept separate
- vm:101 is currently on node1
- vm:102 and vm:103 are currently on node1, which must be separated

The expected outcome is:
- As vm:102 and vm:103 are still on the same node, make vm:102 migrate to node2
  to fulfill its node affinity rule
