Test whether a service in a unrestricted group with two node members will stay
assigned to one of the node members in case of a failover of their previously
assigned node.

The test scenario is:
- vm:101 should be kept on node2 or node3
- vm:101 is currently running on node3
- node2 has a higher service count than node1 to test whether the restriction
  to node2 and node3 is applied even though the scheduler would prefer the less
  utilized node1

The expected outcome is:
- As node3 fails, vm:101 is migrated to node2, as it's the only available node
  left in the unrestricted group
