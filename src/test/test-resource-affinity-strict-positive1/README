Test whether a strict positive resource affinity rule makes two resources migrate
to the same recovery node in case of a failover of their previously assigned
node.

The test scenario is:
- vm:101 and vm:102 must be kept together
- vm:101 and vm:102 are both currently running on node3
- node1 and node2 have the same resource count to test that the rule is applied
  even though it would be usually balanced between both remaining nodes

The expected outcome is:
- As node3 fails, both resources are migrated to node1
