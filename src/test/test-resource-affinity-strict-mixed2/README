The test scenario is:
- vm:101, vm:102, and vm:103 must be kept together
- vm:201, vm:202, and vm:203 must be kept together
- vm:101 and vm:201 must be kept separate
- Therefore, vm:101, vm:102, and vm:103 must all be kept separate from vm:201,
  vm:202, and vm:203 and vice versa
- vm:101, vm:103, vm:201, and vm:203 are currently running on node1
- vm:102 and vm:202 are running on node3 and node2 respectively

The expected outcome is:
- The resource-node placements do not adhere to the defined resource affinity
  rules, therefore the HA resources must be moved accordingly: As vm:101 and
  vm:103 must be kept separate from vm:201 and vm:203, which are all currently
  running on node1, these must be migrated to separate nodes:
    - As the negative resource affinity rule is strict, resources must neither
      share the current nor the migration target node, so both positive
      affinity groups must be put on "spare" nodes, which in that case is node3
      (for vm:101 and vm:103) and node2 (for vm:201 and vm:203) respectively.
      These node selections are because there are already other positive
      resource affinity rule members running on these nodes (vm:102 on node3
      and vm:202 on node2).
