The test scenario is:
- vm:101, vm:102, and vm:103 must be kept together
- vm:201, vm:202, and vm:203 must be kept together
- vm:101 and vm:201 must be kept separate
- Therefore, vm:101, vm:102, and vm:103 must all be kept separate from vm:201,
  vm:202, and vm:203 and vice versa
- vm:101, vm:103, vm:201, and vm:203 are currently running on node1
- vm:102 and vm:202 are running on node3 and node2 respectively

The current outcome is incorrect.
