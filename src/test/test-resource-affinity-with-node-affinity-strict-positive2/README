Test whether a strict positive resource affinity rule among three resources,
where one of these resources is restricted to another node than they are
currently on with a node affinity rule, makes all resources migrate to that
node.

The test scenario is:
- vm:102 must be kept on node1 or node2
- vm:101, vm:102, and vm:103 must be kept together
- vm:101, vm:102, and vm:103 are currently running on node3

The expected outcome is:
- As vm:102 is on node3, which contradicts its node affinity rule, vm:102 is
  migrated to node1 to fullfill its node affinity rule
- As vm:102 is in a positive resource affinity rule with vm:101 and vm:103, all
  of them are migrated to node1 as these are inferred for all of them
