Test whether a service in a strict node affinity rule will automatically
migrate back to a restricted node member in case of a manual migration to a
non-member node.

The test scenario is:
- vm:101 must be kept on node3
- vm:101 is currently running on node3

The expected outcome is:
- As vm:101 is manually migrated to node2, it is migrated back to node3, as
  node3 is the only available node member left in the strict node affinity rule
