Test whether two pair-wise strict negative resource affinity rules, i.e. where
one resource is in two separate negative resource affinity rules with two other
resources, makes one of the outer resources migrate to the same node as the other
outer resource in case of a failover of their previously assigned node.

The test scenario is:
- vm:101 and vm:102, and vm:101 and vm:103 must each be kept separate
- vm:101, vm:102, and vm:103 are respectively on node1, node2, and node3

The expected outcome is:
- As node3 fails, vm:103 is migrated to node2 - the same as vm:102
