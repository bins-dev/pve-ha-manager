Test whether a service in a unrestricted group will automatically migrate back
to a node member in case of a manual migration to a non-member node.

The test scenario is:
- vm:101 should be kept on node3
- vm:101 is currently running on node3

The expected outcome is:
- As vm:101 is manually migrated to node2, it is migrated back to node3, as
  node3 is a group member and has higher priority than the other nodes
