Test whether a strict negative resource affinity rule among three resources makes
one of the resource, which is manually migrated to another resource's node, where
the resource is in negative affinity with the migrated resource, stay on the node
of the other resources.

The test scenario is:
- vm:101, vm:102, and vm:103 must be kept separate
- vm:101, vm:102, and vm:103 are all running on node1, node2, and node3

The expected outcome is:
- vm:101 cannot be migrated to node3 as it would conflict the negative resource
  affinity rule between vm:101, vm:102 and vm:103.
