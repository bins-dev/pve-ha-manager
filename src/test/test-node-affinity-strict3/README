Test whether a service in a restricted group with only one node member will
stay in recovery in case of a failover of their previously assigned node.

The test scenario is:
- vm:101 must be kept on node3
- vm:101 is currently running on node3

The expected outcome is:
- As node3 fails, vm:101 stays in recovery since there's no available node
  member left in the restricted group
