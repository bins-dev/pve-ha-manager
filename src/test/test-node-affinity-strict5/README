Test whether a service in a strict node affinity rule with two differently
prioritized node members will stay on the node with the highest priority in
case of a failover or when the service is on a lower-priority node.

The test scenario is:
- vm:101 must be kept on node2 or node3
- vm:101 is currently running on node3
- node2 has a higher priority than node3

The expected outcome is:
- As vm:101 runs on node3, it is automatically migrated to node2, as node2 has
  a higher priority than node3
- As node2 fails, vm:101 is migrated to node3 as node3 is the next and only
  available node member left in the strict node affinity rule
- As node2 comes back online, vm:101 is migrated back to node2, as node2 has a
  higher priority than node3
