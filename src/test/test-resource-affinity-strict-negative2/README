Test whether a strict negative resource affinity rule among three resources makes
one of the resources migrate to a different node than the other resources in case
of a failover of the resource's previously assigned node.

The test scenario is:
- vm:101, vm:102, and vm:103 must be kept separate
- vm:101, vm:102, and vm:103 are on node3, node4, and node5 respectively
- node1 and node2 have each both higher resource counts than node3, node4 and
  node5 to test the rule is applied even though the scheduler would prefer the
  less utilized nodes node3 and node4

The expected outcome is:
- As node5 fails, vm:103 is migrated to node2; even though the utilization of
  node2 is high already, the resources must be kept separate; node2 is chosen
  since node1 has one more resource running on it
