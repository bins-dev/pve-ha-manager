Test whether an initial (unsupported) mixed version cluster can be properly
upgraded per major version and then the CRM correctly migrates the HA group
config only after all nodes have at least the proper pre-release version.

By rebooting every node after each version change, this tests whether the
switching of the CRM node and a few instances of LRM restarts are properly
prohibiting the HA groups config migration.
