Test whether a strict negative resource affinity rule among two resources makes
one of the resource, which is manually migrated to another node, be migrated
there and disallows other resources, which are in negative affinity with the
migrated resource, to not be migrated to the migrated resource's source node.

The test scenario is:
- vm:101 and vm:102 must be kept separate
- vm:101 and vm:102 are running on node1 and node2 respectively

The expected outcome is:
- vm:101 is migrated to node3
- While vm:101 is migrated, vm:102 cannot be migrated to node1, as vm:101 is
  still putting load on node1 as its source node
- After vm:101 is successfully migrated to node3, vm:102 can be migrated to
  node1
