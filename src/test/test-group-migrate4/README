Test whether a cluster, where all nodes have the same version from the previous
major release, can be properly upgraded to the neede major release version and
then the CRM correctly migrates the HA group config only after all nodes have
the minimum major release version.

Additionally, the nodes are rebooted with every version upgrade and in-between
the CFS sporadically fails to read/write, fails to update cluster state and an
LRM is restarted, which all prohibit the HA groups config migration.
