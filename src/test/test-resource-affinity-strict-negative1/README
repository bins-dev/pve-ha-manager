Test whether a strict negative resource affinity rule among two resources makes
one of the resources migrate to a different recovery node than the other in case
of a failover of their previously assigned node.

The test scenario is:
- vm:101 and vm:102 must be kept separate
- vm:101 and vm:102 are currently running on node2 and node3 respectively
- node1 has a higher resource count than node2 to test the resource affinity rule
  is applied even though the scheduler would prefer the less utilized node

The expected outcome is:
- As node3 fails, vm:102 is migrated to node1; even though the utilization of
  node1 is high already, the resources must be kept separate
