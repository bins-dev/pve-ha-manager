Test whether a strict negative resource affinity rule among three resources,
where two resources are restricted each to nodes they are not yet on, can be
exchanged to the nodes described by their node affinity rules, if one of the
resources is stopped.

The test scenario is:
- vm:101, vm:102, and vm:103 should be on node2, node3 or node1 respectively
- vm:101, vm:102, and vm:103 must be kept separate
- vm:101, vm:102, and vm:103 are currently on node1, node2, node3 respectively

The expected outcome is:
- the resources can neither be manually migrated nor automatically exchange
  their nodes to match their node affinity rules, because of the strict
  condition, that they cannot be on either a node, where a resource with
  negative affinity is currently on or is migrated to
- therefore, one of the resources must be stopped manually to allow the
  rearrangement to fullfill the node affinity rules
