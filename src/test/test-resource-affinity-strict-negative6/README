Test whether a strict negative resource affinity rule among two resources makes
one of the resources migrate to a different recovery node than the other resource
in case of a failover of the resource's previously assigned node. As the other
resource fails to starts on the recovery node (e.g. insufficient resources), the
failing resource is kept on the recovery node.

The test scenario is:
- fa:120001 and fa:220001 must be kept separate
- fa:120001 and fa:220001 are on node2 and node3 respectively
- fa:120001 and fa:220001 will fail to start on node1
- node1 has a higher resource count than node2 to test the resource affinity rule
  is applied even though the scheduler would prefer the less utilized node

The expected outcome is:
- As node3 fails, fa:220001 is migrated to node1
- fa:220001 will stay on the node (potentially in recovery), since it cannot be
  started on node1, but cannot be relocated to another one either due to the
  strict resource affinity rule
