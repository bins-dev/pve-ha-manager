Test whether a strict positive resource affinity rule makes three resources
migrate to the same recovery node in case of a failover of their previously
assigned node.

The test scenario is:
- vm:101, vm:102, and vm:103 must be kept together
- vm:101, vm:102, and vm:103 are all currently running on node3

The expected outcome is:
- As node3 fails, all resources are migrated to node2, as node2 is less utilized
  than the other available node1
