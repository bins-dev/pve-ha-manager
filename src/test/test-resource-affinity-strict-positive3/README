Test whether a strict positive resource affinity rule makes three resources
migrate to the same recovery node in case of a failover of their previously
assigned node. If one of those fail to start on the recovery node (e.g.
insufficient resources), all resources in the positive resource affinity rule
will be migrated to another available recovery node.

The test scenario is:
- vm:101, vm:102, and fa:120002 must be kept together
- vm:101, vm:102, and fa:120002 are all currently running on node3
- fa:120002 will fail to start on node2
- node1 has a higher resource count than node2 so that node2 is selected for
  migration so that fa:12002 is guaranteed to fail there

The expected outcome is:
- As node3 fails, all resources are migrated to node2
- Two of those resources will start successfully, but fa:120002 will fail; as
  there are other available nodes left where it can run, all resources in the
  positive resource affinity rule are migrated to the next-best fitting node
