Test whether a strict negative resource affinity rule among three resources,
where all resources are in a node affinity rule restricting them to three
nodes, are migrated to these nodes as all three resources are still on a common
node outside of the cluster.

The test scenario is:
- vm:101, vm:102, and vm:103 should be on node2, node3 or node4
- vm:101, vm:102, and vm:103 must be kept separate
- vm:101, vm:102, and vm:103 is currently on node1

The expected outcome is:
- As vm:101, vm:102, and vm:103 are still on the same node and should be on
  node2, node3 or node4, migrate them to node2, node3, and node4 respectively
