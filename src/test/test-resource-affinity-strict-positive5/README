Test whether multiple connected positive resource affinity rules makes the
resources stay together, if one of the resources is manually migrated to another
node, i.e., migrate all of them to the same node.

The test scenario is:
- vm:101, vm:102, and vm:103 must be kept together
- vm:103, vm:104, and vm:105 must be kept together
- vm:105, vm:106, and vm:107 must be kept together
- vm:105, vm:108, and vm:109 must be kept together
- So essentially, vm:101 through vm:109 must be kept together
- vm:101 through vm:109 are all on node1

The expected outcome is:
- As vm:103 is migrated to node2, all of vm:101 through vm:109 are migrated to
  node2 as well, as these all must be kept together
- As vm:101 is migrated to node3, all of vm:101 through vm:109 are migrated to
  node3 as well, as these all must be kept together
- As vm:109 is migrated to node1, all of vm:101 through vm:109 are migrated to
  node1 as well, as these all must be kept together
