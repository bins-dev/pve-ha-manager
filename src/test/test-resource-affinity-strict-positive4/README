Test whether a strict positive resource affinity rule of three resources makes
the resources stay together, if one of the resources is manually migrated to
another node, i.e., migrate to the same node.

The test scenario is:
- vm:101, vm:102, and vm:103 must be kept together
- vm:101, vm:102, and vm:103 are all currently running on node1

The expected outcome is:
- As vm:101 is migrated to node2, vm:102 and vm:103 are migrated to node2 as
  well as a side-effect to follow the positive resource affinity rule.
