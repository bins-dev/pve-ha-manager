Test whether a service in a unrestricted group with only one node member will
be migrated to a non-member node in case of a failover of their previously
assigned node.

The test scenario is:
- vm:101 should be kept on node3
- vm:101 is currently running on node3

The expected outcome is:
- As node3 fails, vm:101 is migrated to node1
