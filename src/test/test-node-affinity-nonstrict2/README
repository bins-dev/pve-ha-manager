Test whether a service in a non-strict node affinity rule, where the service
has failback disabled, will stay on the manual migration target node, even
though the target node is not a member of the non-strict node affinity rule.

The test scenario is:
- vm:101 should be kept on node3
- vm:101 is currently running on node3

The expected outcome is:
- As vm:101 is manually migrated to node2, vm:101 stays on node2; even though
  node2 is not a rule member, the disabled failback flag prevents vm:101 to be
  migrated back to a rule member.
