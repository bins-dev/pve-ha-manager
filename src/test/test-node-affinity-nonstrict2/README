Test whether a service in a unrestricted group with nofailback enabled will
stay on the manual migration target node, even though the target node is not a
member of the unrestricted group.

The test scenario is:
- vm:101 should be kept on node3
- vm:101 is currently running on node3

The expected outcome is:
- As vm:101 is manually migrated to node2, vm:101 stays on node2; even though
  node2 is not a group member, the nofailback flag prevents vm:101 to be
  migrated back to a group member
