pve-ha-manager (5.0.5) trixie; urgency=medium

  * manager: support older versioning schema for ha group migration.

  * fix #6839: move PVE::Notify usage to "real" Env to avoid error in HA
    simulator on non-PVE systems.

  * fix #6881: api: relocate resource: fix check to avoid Perl warning.

  * manager: fix precedence in mixed resource affinity rules usage that could
    lead to a resource not getting migrated while it could be.

pve-ha-manager (5.0.4) trixie; urgency=medium

  * api: rules: cope if disable parameter is explicitly set to a falsy value.

  * rules: make positive affinity resources migrate on single resource fail.

  * rules: allow same resources in node and resource affinity rules but
    restrict inter-plugin resource references to simple cases:
    - the resources of a resource affinity rule are not part of any node
      affinity rule, which has multiple priority groups. This is because of
      the dynamic nature of priority groups.
    - the resources of a positive resource affinity rule are part of at most
      one node affinity rule, but no more. Otherwise, it is not easily
      decidable (yet) what the common node restrictions are.
    - the positive resource affinity rules, which have at least one resource
      which is part of one node affinity rule, make all the resources part of
      the node affinity rule.
    - the resources of a negative resource affinity rule are not restricted
      by their node affinity rules in such a way that these do not have enough
      nodes to be separated on.

pve-ha-manager (5.0.3) trixie; urgency=medium

  * rules: add global checks between node and resource affinity rules, being
    currently overly strict in what is allowed and what not, e.g. combinations
    of any resources-to-nodes and resources-to-resources rules are not
    allowed, this safety constraint will be loosened in a future version to
    allow simple cases that are always straight forward to resolve.

  * manager: apply resource affinity rules when selecting service nodes.

  * api: resources: add check for resource affinity in resource migrations.

pve-ha-manager (5.0.2) trixie; urgency=medium

  * watchdog-mux: restore if guard for watchdog updates to avoid an recent
    regression causing an extra round of delay when fencing due to client
    timeout.

  * introduce HA affinity rules, which will replace the HA groups and provide
    the groundwork for future service-to-service affinity rules.

  * manager: migrate ha groups to node affinity rules in-memory and write out
    the new config once all nodes have a recent enough pve-manager version
    installed, which depends on the new ha-manager version.

  * api: groups: disallow calls to HA groups endpoints if already fully
    migrated to affinity rules.

 -- Proxmox Support Team <support@proxmox.com>  Mon, 07 Apr 2025 23:24:19 +0200

pve-ha-manager (4.0.6) bookworm; urgency=medium

  * tools: group verbose description: explicitly state that higher number
    means a higher priority

  * fix #5243: make CRM go idle after ~15 min of no service being configured.
    This is mostly cosmetic as the CRM never needed to trigger self-fencing on
    quorum-loss anyway, as all state under the CRM's control is managed by the
    pmxcfs, which is already protected by quorum and cluster synchronisation.

  * crm: get active if there are pending CRM commands and it seems that no CRM
    is already active. This ensures any CRM command, like disabling the
    node-maintenance mode is properly processed. Currently this is mostly
    cosmetic though, but not unimportant as we show the maintenance state in
    the UI since not that long ago.

  * crm: get active if there are nodes that probably need to leave maintenance
    mode. This is very similar to the point above but is less likely to
    trigger if just CLI/API is used.

    that the request for (manual) maintenance mode is upheld, even if the node

  * manager: add new intermediate 'request_started' state for stop->start

    the current node on which a service is located.

pve-ha-manager (3.3-2) bullseye; urgency=medium

  * fix #3826: fix restarting LRM/CRM when triggered by package management
    system due to other updates

  * lrm: also check CRM node-status for determining if there's a fence-request
    and avoid starting up in that case to ensure that the current manager can
    get our lock and do a clean fence -> unknown -> online FSM transition.
    This avoids a problematic edge case where an admin manually removed all
    services of a to-be-fenced node, and re-added them again before the
    manager could actually get that nodes LRM lock.

  * manage: handle edge case where a node gets seemingly stuck in 'fence'
    state if all its services got manually removed by an admin before the
    fence transition could be finished. While the LRM could come up again in
    previous versions (it won't now, see above point) and start/stop services
    got executed, the node was seen as unavailable for all recovery,
    relocation and migrate actions.

pve-ha-manager (3.3-1) bullseye; urgency=medium

  * LRM: release lock and close watchdog if no service configured for >10min

  * manager: make recovery actual state in finite state machine, showing a
    clear transition from fence -> reocvery.

  * fix #3415: never switch in error state on recovery, try to find a new node
    harder. This improves using the HA manager for services with local
    resources (e.g., local storage) to ensure it always gets started, which is
    an OK use-case as long as the service is restricted to a group with only
    that node. Previously failure of that node would have a high possibility
    of the service going into the errors state, as no new node can be found.
    Now it will retry finding a new node, and if one of the restricted set,
    e.g., the node it was previous on, comes back up, it will start again
    there.

  * recovery: allow disabling a in-recovery service manually
